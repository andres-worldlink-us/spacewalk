# Angular 18 Upgrade - Vulnerability Status

## Remaining Vulnerabilities (11 total: 6 low, 5 moderate)

The following vulnerabilities remain after Angular 18 upgrade:
- esbuild (moderate): Development server vulnerability
- tmp (moderate): Build tool vulnerability  

## Resolution Strategy

These vulnerabilities can only be resolved by upgrading to Angular 20+, which is beyond the scope of this Angular 18 upgrade. All vulnerabilities are in development dependencies and build tools, not production runtime code.

These will be addressed in future Angular version upgrades (19 â†’ 20) following the incremental upgrade path.
